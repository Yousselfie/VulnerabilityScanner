    20:["FTP - File Transfer Protocol",
        "Used for transferring files between a client and server.",
        "Hackers can exploit FTP through weak or default credentials, allowing unauthorized access to files. Unencrypted FTP traffic can be intercepted and read (man-in-the-middle attacks)."],
    21:["FTP - File Transfer Protocol",
        "Used for transferring files between a client and server.",
        "Hackers can exploit FTP through weak or default credentials, allowing unauthorized access to files. Unencrypted FTP traffic can be intercepted and read (man-in-the-middle attacks)."],
    22:["SSH - Secure Shell",
        "Used for secure remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network.",
        "Exploitable through brute force attacks or if weak credentials are used. If compromised, attackers can gain full control over the affected system."],
    23:["Telnet",
        "Used for unencrypted text communications between a client and server.",
        "Since Telnet transmits data in plaintext, it is susceptible to interception and eavesdropping, allowing attackers to capture sensitive information."],
    25:["SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol",
        "Used for sending email messages between servers.",
        "Open relays can be used to send spam. Weak security configurations can lead to email spoofing or interception."],
    53:["DNS - Domain Name System",
        "Translates domain names to IP addresses.",
        "Vulnerable to DNS spoofing and cache poisoning, leading users to malicious websites."],
    80:["HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol",
        "Used for transmitting web pages over the internet.",
        "Susceptible to a variety of web-based attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and man-in-the-middle attacks if not secured properly."],
    110:["POP3 - Post Office Protocol 3",
         "Used by email clients to retrieve emails from a server.",
         "Transmits data in plaintext, making it vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping attacks."],
    143:["IMAP - Internet Message Access Protocol",
         "Used by email clients to retrieve messages from a mail server and manage them.",
         "Similar to POP3, can be vulnerable to interception and credential harvesting if not encrypted (use of IMAP over SSL/TLS is recommended)."],
    443:["HTTPS - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure",
         "Used for secure communication over a computer network, widely used on the internet.",
         "Though encrypted, vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS implementation or certificate misconfigurations can be exploited. Man-in-the-middle attacks can occur if security is not properly enforced."],
    445:["SMB - Server Message Block",
         "Used for sharing files, printers, and other network resources.",
         "Vulnerable to numerous exploits, including the infamous WannaCry ransomware attack. Weak authentication can lead to unauthorized access."],
    3389:["RDP - Remote Desktop Protocol",
          "Used for remote management of Windows machines.",
          "Brute force attacks on weak passwords can give attackers control over a system. Vulnerabilities in RDP can lead to unauthorized access or spread of malware."],
    8080:["HTTP Proxy",
          "Often used as an alternative to port 80 for web traffic, commonly for web proxies.",
          "Similar to port 80, it can be subject to web-based attacks like XSS, SQL injection, and proxy-related vulnerabilities."]
